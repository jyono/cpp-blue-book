Hello hello and welcome to my repo. I am taking it upon myself to take a deep dive
into C++ language through Bjarne Stroustrup's book `The C++ Programming Language`.

I have a passion for bleeding edge tools and want to build them. Due to the reliability, blazing fast speed,
and low level capabilities, C++ is an ideal weapon for this.
I believe that C++ encapsulates many of the first principles of programming as well as support
for the various language paradigms (Object Oriented, Functional, Procedural, etc.). The language is a building block
for many other programming languages and tools that have shaped the world around us.

This book starts giving a "lighting tour" in chapters 1-5.
I am choosing to skip those chapters in this guide. I will start in Chapter 6 with a deep dive into the basic data types
and move forward from there.
